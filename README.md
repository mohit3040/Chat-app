This Real-Time Chat App is built using React.js for the front-end and Socket.IO for real-time, bi-directional communication between users. The app enables instant messaging between multiple clients with seamless UI updates. Users can join a chat room, send and receive messages in real time without refreshing the page. React manages the dynamic interface, ensuring smooth user interactions, while Socket.IO handles the WebSocket connections, maintaining live communication with the server. The app supports features like user notifications, message timestamps, and dynamic chat room management. Itâ€™s ideal for collaborative platforms, support systems, or social messaging environments.
